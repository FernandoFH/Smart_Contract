what does it solve?
The double-spending problem.

How does it work?
Deterministic: the same message always results in the same hash;
Fast: the hash value for any given message is computed quickly;
Resistant: it is not feasible to generate a message from its hash value except by trying all possible messages;
Avalanche effect: a small change to a message changes the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old value;
Unique: it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value.
