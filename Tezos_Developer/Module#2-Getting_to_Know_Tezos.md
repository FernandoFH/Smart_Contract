### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts have several benefits:

- They facilitate the process of forming self-executing contracts through the use of protocols and user interfaces.
- Smart contracts reduce transaction costs by automating stipulated actions. The need for often costly and time-consuming litigation is potentially reduced drastically, because parties can be forced to comply with the rules and specifications of their contract by including stipulated actions in the underlying code. This makes smart contracts largely self-enforcing.

#### Contract Dimensions and Applying Blockchains

- Observability by contract principals
- Verifiability by third parties such as auditors and adjudicators
- And privity

#### Important Dimensions in Contracting

- Observability 
- Verifiability 
- Privity 

#### There are currently three Tezos networks:

- *Mainnet*, for production, has been live and open since 30 June 2018,
- *Alphanet*, a test network that runs the same code as the mainnet, and
- *Zeronet*, a cutting-edge development network that may have different constants from mainnet or alphanet.

#### Alphanet

The **alphanet** is the test network of choice for most developers, running the same code as the mainnet and complete with a faucet for free tez to test contracts.
